Path of Exile Map Tracking 

Cartogram is a desktop application to track maps ran by both yourself and party members. It tracks experience gained, map drops, currency, uniques and divination cards. It uses mostly clipboard data delivered by the Path of Exile client. 

Trello board of current to-do and working features: https://trello.com/b/12igsJuT/cartogram

**Working Features**

- Logging maps you have ran, including their quantity, quality, rarity and affixes.
- Logging the map drops attatched to a map ran (currency, uniques and divination cards)
- Duration of a running map
- Logging map drops from Zana and Cartographers found
- Adding notes to each map (eg. Shav's dropped for some guy in this map / X died from Y in here)
- Customizable hotkeys for stoping maps/zana/cartos etc.

**Planned Features**

- Zana Dailies
- Reporting to spreadsheet/Google docs to share your results.
- Add MySQL inserts to correlate mass users information

Currently experience logging is disabled (a rudamentry OCR parse on the tooltip) in anticipation for an in-game feature to give the ability to CTRL+C your experience bar and get the values to the clipboard. This is apparently in GGG's issue tracker of things to implement.
- Experience gained per map (including a smaller percent of level eg. 0.64% of a level)
