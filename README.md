# Cartogram
Path of Exile Map Tracking 

Cartogram is a desktop application to track maps ran by both yourself and party members. It tracks experience gained, map drops, currency, uniques and divination cards. It uses mostly clipboard data delivered by the Path of Exile client. 

Trello board of current to-do and working features: https://trello.com/b/12igsJuT/cartogram
Occasionally development will be streamed on Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/0ministry

**Working Features**

- Logging maps you have ran, including their quantity, quality, rarity and affixes.
- Logging the map drops attatched to a map ran (currency, uniques and divination cards)
- Duration of a running map
- Logging map drops from Zana and Cartographers found
- Adding notes to each map (eg. Shav's dropped for some guy in this map / X died from Y in here)
- Customizable hotkeys for stoping maps/zana/cartos etc.
- Reporting to spreadsheet/Google docs to share your results.
- Overlay with basic information
 

**Planned Features**

- Basic reporting graphs/data
- Zana Dailies
- Fragment Farming
- Atziri Farming
- OPT-IN MySQL data collection to correlate mass user data

**Feature is ready but not supported in-game.**

I've messaged GGG a handful of times with a proposed solution but it is not implemented in game as of yet. I hope that on public release of this application that GGG will be incentivized to make this easy for benefit of the community.
- Experience gained per map (including a smaller percent of level eg. 0.64% of a level)
